##Usage

###Initialize GCManager
You should initialize GCManager when your app is launched preferably in

<pre>
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions 
</pre>

by calling

<pre>
    [GCManager sharedManager];
</pre>

This checks if Game Center is supported in the current device, authenticates the player and synchronizes scores and achievements from Game Center if its being run for the first time.

###Check Game Center Support
To check for Game Center support you can call

<pre>
    [[GCManager sharedManager] isGameCenterAvailable];
</pre>


###Report Score
To report a score to Game Center, call

<pre>
    [[GCManager sharedManager] saveAndReportScore:1000
                                              leaderboard:@"HighScores"];
</pre>

This method saves the score locally as well.

###Report Achievement
To report an achievement to Game Center, call

<pre>
    [[GCManager sharedManager] saveAndReportAchievement:@"1000Points"
                                                percentComplete:50];
</pre>

This method saves the achievement progress locally as well.

###Get High Scores
To get the high scores for the current player, you can call

<pre>
    //Array of leaderboard ID's to get high scores for
    NSArray *leaderboardIDs = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Leaderboard1", @"Leaderboard2", nil];

    //Returns a dictionary with leaderboard ID's as keys and high scores as values
    [[GCManager defaultManager] highScoreForLeaderboards:leaderboardIDs];
</pre>

###Get Achievement Progress
To get achievement progress for the current player, you can call

<pre>
    //Array of achievement ID's to get progress for
    NSArray *achievementIDs = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Achievement1", @"Achievement2", nil];

    //Returns a dictionary with achievement ID's as keys and progress as values
    [[GCManager defaultManager] progressForAchievements:achievementIDs];
</pre>

###Notifications
Notifications are posted at certain events mentioned below. The `userInfo` dictionary contains an error string for the key `error` if an error occured.

1. kGCManagerAvailabilityNotification - When unsupported devices attempt to authenticate the player, the `isGameCenterAvailable` property is set to `NO`
2. kGCManagerReportScoreNotification - When a score is reported to Game Center
3. kGCManagerReportAchievementNotification - When an achievement is reported to Game Center
4. kGCManagerResetAchievementNotification - When achievements are reset

###ARC support

GCManager uses ARC.
If you are using GCManager in your non-arc project, you will need to set a -fobjc-arc compiler flag on all of the GCManager source files.
To set a compiler flag in Xcode, go to your active target and select the "Build Phases" tab. Now select all GCManager source files, press Enter, insert -fobjc-arc and then "Done" to disable ARC for GCManager.
